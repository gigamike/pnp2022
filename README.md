DTI Quick Connect Portal

We created an app called "DTI Quick Connect Portal." DTI Quick Connect Portal is an online portal and ticketing system for complaints reported by online consumers. What makes our system unique is the way it can easily be integrated with other online platforms for collecting and tracking complaint reports. With our smart chatbot, the filing of complaints is more human and interactional. The chatbot also provides useful tools for online consumers, such as the Website Reputation Checker and educating consumers through the DTI consumer knowledgebase. Ticket complaints can be assigned or tagged internally to DTI or interagency to solve the problem at the level of service expected.
