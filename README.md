ITMS Project KaagaPI

Digitize tracking and less paperwork 

From the Tagalog words "Kaagapay" and "Raspberry PI," we developed an app with a device called ITMS Project KaagaPI. ITMS Project KaagaPI is a portal with a device that is vital in monitoring of kidnapped cars to be used by our PNP government agencies (hotlist) as well as it eliminates manual tracking of in and out of cars into a facility (whitelist).

Instant alert and improved administration: 

The ITMS Project KaagaPI aims to make it convenient for interagency in uploading the plate numbers for the "hotlist" and "white list". Raspberry PI device is placed at a strategic area, such as the parking lots of malls, subdivision entrances, or toll gates. When a plate number is photographed, it will be automatically uploaded to the ITMS KaagapI site, and checked/matched to see if it is on a hotlist, the device sends an SMS alert notice to the closest officer, pushing them to take urgent action.

Cost saving and improved User satisfaction:

ITMS Project KaagaPI provides real-time plate number monitoring using an LOW-COST Raspberry PI, PIR Sensor, and Camera combination. This helps PNP reduce its operational expenses while maintaining tracking resolutions and completing the job quickly and effectively.
